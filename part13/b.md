# Join tables and queries

## Application structuring
- the idea of making the finding entity logic as a middleware: bit hesitating to implement

## User management
- reviewing part4

## Connection between the tables
- how to relate two different tables: *foreign key*
- join query

## Proper insertion of notes
- review of token authentication

## Fine-tuning
- fetching only the part of data we want
- instead of directly defining foreign keys, we simply utilize the ORM's API conveniently

## Attention to the definition of the models

## More queries
- advanced queries for backend
