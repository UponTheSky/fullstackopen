# Fundamentals of Web Apps

## HTTP GET
- HTTP get request & response with status code 200
- HEADERS tab
  - size of the response
  - time of response
  - `Content-Type`

- Response tab: the response data

- how is the sequence of fetching requests made?
1. the browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server, to fetch the HTML code of the page
2. any tags like `<img>` in the HTML prompts the browser to fetch additional data
3. then the browser renders the HTML page using data fetched to the screen

- remark: HTML begins to render before other data finishes to be fetched

## Traditional web applications
- traditional webapps: the browser fetches the HTML document detailing the structure and the textual content of the page from the server
  - the document is either a static text file or a dynamically created file(by the application's code)
  - traditionally, browsers only fetched HTML data from the server, and all application logic is on the server
  - Java Spring, Ruby on Rails, PHP

## Running application logic in the browser
- HTML document file and `<script>`: fetches a JS code file
- old-style JS code to fetch data from the server
- JSON

## Event handlers and Callback functions
- **event handler** for an event: a function such that when the event happens, the browser calls it
- **callback** function(from an [MDN document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function))
> A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

- so every event handlers are callback functions

## DOM
- an HTML page forms a tree structure of tags(HTML elements) = **element tree**
- **DOM**: an API which enbles programming modification of the element trees corresponding to web-pages

## Manipulating the document-object from console
- how to get access to DOM?
- `document` object in the browser

## CSS
- called by `<link>` tag
- class selectors, attributes of HTML elements

## Loading a page containing JS - review
- the procedure of loading a page containing JS
1. a HTTP GET request is made by the browser: fetches the HTML code defining the content and the structure of the page from the server
2. links in the HTML cause the browser to fetch one CSS and one JS files consequently(if there are)
3. the browser executes the JS code, which could again make another request to fetch additional data
4. when data is fetched, the browser executes an event handler, which may renders some other elements to the page using the DOM-API

## Forms and HTTP POST
- form element, HTTP POST request
- 302 URL redirect: the server asks the browser to do a new HTTP GET request to the address defined in the header's `Location`

- so the browser reloads the current page(fetching the three files and the JSON data again)

## AJAX

- AJAX(Asynchronous JS and XML): a new revolutionary approach(at that time) enabling the fetching of content to web pages using JS included within the HTML, without the need to rerender the entire page
  - from [this part](#running-application-logic-in-the-browser)
  - early 2000's web technology
  - prior to AJAX, all data shown on the page was fetched with the HTML-code generated by the server(without JS): [this part](#traditional-web-applications)

## SPA
- SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately from the server
- instead, they comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, the contents of which are manipulated with JS that executes in the browser

- 201 created: not asking for a redirect, the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP requests

- SPA apps usually don't send the form data in the traditional way; rather they instead use the JS code it fetches from the server
  - preventing default behavior: `e.preventDefault`
