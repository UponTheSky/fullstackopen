# Introduction to React

## Component
- function components

## JSX
- under the hood, this HTML-look-like piece of code(**JSX**) is compiled into JS, by **Babel**
  - it is okay to write pure JS code in React, but not recommended

- difference btw pure HTML tags?
  - easily embed dynamic content
  - JSX is much closer to XML(every tag needs to be closed) than HTML

## Multiple components
- writing a component inside another
- **root component**: usually `App.tsx` but could be wrapped within another utility component

## props: passing data to components
- skim through this part

## Some notes
- skim through this part
