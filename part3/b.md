# Deploying app to internet

## Same origin policy and CORS
- **same origin policy**: the JS code of an application that runs in a browser can only commmunicate with a server in the same origin
- **CORS**(cross origin resource sharing): allows such external domains to be able to access to resources

## Application to the Internet
- use fly.io
- skim through this part at the moment
- basically, see: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/integrating-with-an-api-backend and https://create-react-app.dev/docs/title-and-meta-tags

## Frontend production build
- skim through this part at the moment

## Serving static files from the backend
- skim through this part

## The whole app to internet
- skim through this part

## Streamlining deploying of the frontend
- skim through this part

## Proxy
- setting `proxy` property in `package.json`: if there is no corresponding url, the request will be redirected to the server specified at `proxy`

- **deployment pipeline**: an automated, and controlled way to move the code from the computer of the developer through different tests and quality checks to the production environment

**remark**: we don't do any exercise of the part3:b at the moment
