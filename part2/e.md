# Adding styles to React app
- "vanilla" CSS
- selectors: which elements the rule should be applied to?
- declarations: what property to be set?

- class selectors: `className` attribute in React file & `.<className>` syntax in CSS file

## Improved error message
- skim through this part

## Inline styles
- any React component or element can be provided with a set of CSS properties as a JS object, through the style attribute
- why inline?: React tries to "create individual components that are as independent and reusable as possible"

**remark**: we skip the ex 2.19~20 here
